Project Recipes: Foundations course

This project is a knowledge check I created during the odin project's foundation course. It demonstrates a basic understanding of Xubuntu, Oracle VM VirtualBox, CLI, VSCode, HTML, CSS and using git & github, and practicing commits, as well as some file structure basics. This will be expanded upon as the course proceeds.
